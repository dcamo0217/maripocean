            Can I come to the camp if travelling alone?

          <Accordion.Body>
            Yes, absolutely! Youâ€™ll fit right in. Our camps have a mix of solo
            travelers, couples, or friends so you will definitely have fun. We
            take care of community activities so you can get to meet people from
            different backgrounds and life stages and experience adventure
            together at water and outside. Youâ€™ll potentially grab some friends
            for life and future trips.

            The weather in Puerto Colombia and Barranquilla is hot and tropical
            by the months of July and August (between 28Â°C and 33Â°C), therefore
            you should dress lightly and comfortable. <br />

            Whatâ€™s the difference between doing this camp and getting private
            lessons for these sports?

            Despertar OceÃ¡nico is an experience that goes beyond a sportive
            class only. Is a trip that looks into connection, fun, balance and
            health. All-inclusive. Is targeting foreign travellers and locals
            that donâ€™t usually live in the area and canâ€™t access these sports
            easily. Or that are locals and need a push to try them. At the same
            time, the opportunity to do the three sports in an balanced way on
            just a long weekend is something that requires motivation and tons
            of logistics, so we take that from you, so you just focus on having
            fun and connecting with nature and others.
