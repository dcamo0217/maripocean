            You need to wear a very comfy bathing suit ideally one piece for
            women or bikini with high coverage. Look for a rashguard so you stay
            protected from the sun and avoid getting sunburn. Bring sunblock
            with 50+ SPF reef friendly, a hat and comfortable flip flops plus
            quick changing clothes for your way back. If you want to use the
            showers from Hotel Pradomar you can do that just be ready to pay in
            cash USD$5 for access pass. With your pass, you will also be able to
            rent a nice bunk on the beach front for any consumption.
